Let's break down the symbols used in the Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) algorithm as applied to a one hidden layer feedforward neural network:

w̄ₖ: The vector of all weights in the network, including both hidden and output layer weights.
σ: A small scalar used for finite difference approximation (typically 10⁻⁴ as shown in the image).
λ₁: Initial value for the scale parameter λₖ (set to 10⁻⁶ in the image).
λ̄₁: Initial value for λ̄ₖ (set to 0 in the image).
p̄₁: Initial search direction (set to -E'(w̄₁), the negative gradient of the error function).
r̄₁: Initial residual vector (also set to -E'(w̄₁)).
E(w̄ₖ): Error function (typically mean squared error or cross-entropy) evaluated at w̄ₖ.
E'(w̄ₖ): Gradient of the error function with respect to the weights.
sₖ: Approximation of the Hessian-vector product.
δₖ: A scalar used in the algorithm's calculations.
μₖ: Another scalar used in the algorithm's calculations.
αₖ: Step size for weight update.
Δₖ: Comparison parameter used to determine if the step is successful.
βₖ: Scalar used to calculate the new search direction.
N: Number of weights in the network (used for restarting the algorithm periodically).
k: Iteration counter.
success: Boolean flag indicating whether the current step was successful.

In the context of a one hidden layer feedforward neural network:

w̄ₖ would include weights connecting the input to hidden layer and hidden to output layer.
E(w̄ₖ) would be calculated by forward propagating through the network and comparing output to targets.
E'(w̄ₖ) would be calculated using backpropagation.
The algorithm aims to find the optimal w̄ₖ that minimizes the error function.

The SCG algorithm uses these symbols to efficiently navigate the error surface and find the optimal weights without requiring a line search at each iteration, making it faster than traditional conjugate gradient methods for neural network training.
